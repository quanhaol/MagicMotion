## üí° Abstract

Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths.
However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality.
Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios.
Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation.
To address these challenges, we introduce **MagicMotion**, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality.
Furthermore, we present **MagicData**, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering.
We also introduce **MagicBench**, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

## üêç Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/quanhaol/MagicMotion
cd MagicMotion

# Install requirements
conda env create -n magicmotion --file environment.yml
conda activate magicmotion
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers

## üîÑ Inference
Inference requires **only 23GB of GPU memory** (tested on a single 24GB NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU).  
If you have sufficient GPU memory, you can modify `magicmotion/inference.py` to improve runtime performance:

```python
# Optimized setting (for GPUs with sufficient memory)
pipe.to("cuda")
# pipe.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
```
> **Note**: Using the optimized setting can reduce runtime by up to 2x.

### Scripts
```bash
# Demo inference script of each stage (Input Image & Trajectory already provided)
bash magicmotion/scripts/inference/inference_mask.sh
bash magicmotion/scripts/inference/inference_box.sh
bash magicmotion/scripts/inference/inference_sparse_box.sh

# You an also construct trajectory for each stage by yourself -- See MagicMotion/trajectory_construction for more details
python trajectory_construction/plan_mask.py
python trajectory_construction/plan_box.py
python trajectory_construction/plan_sparse_box.py

# Optional: Use FLUX to generate input image by text-to-image generation or image editing -- See MagicMotion/first_frame_generation for more details
python first_frame_generation/t2i_flux.py
python first_frame_generation/edit_image_flux.py
```
